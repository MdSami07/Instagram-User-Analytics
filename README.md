# Instagram-User-Analytics
**Project-Description:** In this project, we have performed Instagram User Analytics. User
analytics is a processfor evaluating data that depicts how users adopt, throw themselves into,
and experience products and services. This data can also be merged with user-level attributes
and feedback for further decomposition. Because retaining an existing user is less
expensive than having to find and convert a new one, user analytics can be used to find
meaning in all of the data that your users are generating within your platform and highlight
the key drivers behind what leads to attrition versus the features that keep set your product
apart from the competition. 

The project is all about tracking user activity like how a user
interacts, manages their account, and interconnects with the posts updated by other users.
Then this gathered data is used by the product team and product manager across the business
to decide on several features for an app, track some success factors by estimating the data
extracted by performing user analytics using SQL (Structured Query Language) and also
improve the user experience for better user feedback which leads in the growth of a business.
